## **South by Five Race Results Website**

I designed this website for [Acorn Trails](https://acorntrails.run/), a local charity and running events organizer, to help runners easily review their performance in all races of the series and understand how their position in the general classification changed after each race. The aim is to make it easier for runners to access race results, compare performances, and track their progress across different races.


### **Features**

- Search and filter results by category, park, and name
- Compare performance across races
- Search and category choice stored in local storage
 

### **Technology Stack**
- Node.js
- MongoDB

Users can select a category and click on park names to see the race results for that category. The user's choices are saved in local storage, so that their choices persist when they navigate to another page to check a result for a different race or the general classification after a given race.

In addition, users can also enter a name or names separated by commas to see and/or compare results/general classification positions.

These searches and choices are saved in local storage so that they can compare the results and classification position from race to race.
